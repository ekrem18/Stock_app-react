<h3>About My Project</h3>
<p> This website is designed for an e-commerce system and intended to be used by sellers. After entering criteria such as brand, product, and company, the stock is updated and the overall profit or loss is calculated. Named in consideration of its focus on online shopping and the seller aspect, the project's title was derived. The logo has been designed by me using Photoshop. </p>
